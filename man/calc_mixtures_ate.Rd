\title{Aggregate mixture rules found across the folds that have the same variables and directions. For each rule
extract the relevant nuisance parameter data calculated in the folds. Given the validation data estimates across
the folds, for each tree do a TMLE update step to target the average treatment effect. Update the initial counterfactuals,
calculate the influence curve and using the influence curve calculate variance estimates and p-values.}
\usage{
calc_mixtures_ate(input_mix_rules, input_mix_data, outcome)
}
\arguments{
\item{input_mix_rules}{List of dataframes of rules found for a mixture across the folds}

\item{input_mix_data}{Nuisance parameter data for mixture rules found across the folds}

\item{outcome}{Character indicating the outcome variable}
}
\value{
Rules object. TODO: add more detail here.
