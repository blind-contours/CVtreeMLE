\title{Bound Generalized Propensity Score}
\usage{
bound_propensity(vals)
}
\arguments{
\item{vals}{\code{numeric} vector of propensity score estimate values. Note
that, for this parameter, the propensity score is (conditional) density and
so it ought not be bounded from above.}
}
\value{
A \code{numeric} vector of the same length as \code{vals}, where the
returned values are bounded such that the minimum is no lower than 1/n, for
the sample size n.
}
\description{
Bound Generalized Propensity Score
}
\details{
Bound estimated values of the generalized propensity score (a
conditional density) to avoid numerical instability issues arising from
practical violations of the assumption of positivity.
