> Discovery of Critical Thresholds in Mixed Exposures and Estimation of Policy Intervention Effects using Targeted Learning

__Author:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

---

## What is `CVtreeMLE`?
People often encounter multiple simultaneous exposures (e.g. several drugs or pollutants). Policymakers are interested in setting safe limits, interdictions, or recommended dosage combinations based on a combination of thresholds, one per exposure. Setting these thresholds is difficult because all relevant interactions between exposures must be accounted for. Previous statistical methods have used parametric estimators which do not directly address the question of superadditive or subadditive effects in a mixture, rely on unrealistic assumptions, and do not result in a threshold based statistical quantity that is directly 
relevant to policy regulators. 

Here we present an estimator that a) identifies thresholds that minimize/maximize the expected outcome marginalized over covariates and other exposures; and which b) unbiasedly and efficiently estimates a policy intervention which compares the expected outcome if everyone was forced to these safe levels compared to the observed outcome under observed exposure distribution. This is done by combining a custom g-computation tree-based search algorithm with a targeted maximum likelihood estimator using cross-validation.

This package takes in a mixed exposure, covariates, outcome, super learner stacks
of learners if determined (if not default are used), number of folds, minimum observations in a region, if the desired region is minimizer or maximizer and parallelization parameters.

The output are k-fold specific results for the region found in each fold with valid inference, a pooled estimate of the overall oracle parameter across all folds and pooled exposure sets if the region has some inconsistency across the folds.

## Installation

*Note:* Because `CVtreeMLE` package (currently) depends on `sl3` that
allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance parameter
estimation and `sl3` is not on CRAN the `CVtreeMLE` package is not
available on CRAN and must be downloaded here.

There are many dependencies for `CVtreeMLE` so it's easier to break up 
installation of the various packages to ensure proper installation. 

`CVtreeMLE` uses the `sl3` package to build ensemble machine learners for each nuisance parameter. 
We have to install off the development branch, first download these two packages for `sl3`

```{r super-learner-packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("ranger", "arm", "xgboost", "nnls"))
```

Now install `sl3` on devel:

```{r sl3_devel, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```

Make sure `sl3` installs correctly then install `CVtreeMLE`

```{r CVtreeMLE_install,  eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/CVtreeMLE@main")
```

`CVtreeMLE` has some other miscellaneous dependencies that are used in the examples as well as in the plotting functions. 

```{r msc_package,  eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("kableExtra", "hrbrthemes", "viridis"))
```

---

## Example

First load the package and other packages needed

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(CVtreeMLE)
library(sl3)
library(pre)
library(partykit)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(here)
source(here("sandbox", "simulate_2d_data.R"))

set.seed(429153)
```


To illustrate how `CVtreeMLE` may be used to find and estimate a region that, if intervened on would lead to the biggest reduction in an outcome we use simulated data that is described in our paper: 

https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07976

Briefly, 2 discrete exposures are created based on a multinomial regression from baseline covariates. We create an outcome with main effect and squared interactions. One region has the minimum expected outcome, when both exposures are equal to 1. 

```{r simulate data}

n <- 400
exposure_grid <- expand.grid(seq(5), seq(5))
labels <- apply(exposure_grid, 1, paste, collapse = " ")
exposure_grid <- cbind.data.frame(exposure_grid, labels)

# beta matrix
c_matrix <- matrix(c(0.1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9),
  ncol = 2,
  nrow = 2
)

# Generate simulated data -----------------
P_0_sim <- gen_covariates(n) %>% # gen covariates
  gen_multinom(exposure_grid = exposure_grid) %>% # assign obs to exposure cube
  assign_outcomes(
    exposure_grid = exposure_grid,
    c_matrix = c_matrix
  )

intro_data <- P_0_sim$data
```

## Run `CVtreeMLE`

We will now pass the simulated data and variable names for each 
node in O = W,A,Y to the `CVtreeMLE` function. 

```{r run_simulation, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ptm <- proc.time()

sim_results <- CVtreeMLE(
  data = intro_data,
  w = c("age", "sex", "bmi"),
  a = c("region1", "region2"),
  y = "outcome_obs",
  n_folds = 5,
  parallel_cv = TRUE,
  seed = 2333,
  parallel_type = "multi_session",
  family = "continuous",
  num_cores = 2
)

proc.time() - ptm
```


We can look at the pooled TMLE results for this model. Let's see if 
`CVtreeMLE` identified the thresholds for the minimizing region: 

```{r pooled_mixture_results}
mixture_results <- sim_results$`Pooled TMLE Mixture Results`
mixture_results %>%
  kbl(caption = "Oracle Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Above is the ARE for the region, region 1 = 1 and region 2 = 1. This was found in all the folds so there is no variability in our oracle estimate. The ARE is -0.2 which indicates that if we were to make a policy that forced everyone into exposure levels of 1 for both exposures the expected outcome would be 0.2 less than the current average. 

We can also look at the v-fold specific results: 

```{r fold_specific_results}
sim_results$`V-Specific Mix Results`
```

Here we see the fold specific estimates which are used in the pooled TMLE output we saw earlier. 

Additional details for this and other features are given in the vignette.
