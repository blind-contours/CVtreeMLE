> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Joint Exposure using Data Adaptive Decision Trees and Cross-Validated Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation
__Authors:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

---

## What is `CVtreeMLE`?

The `CVtreeMLE` (Cross-Validated Decision Trees with Targeted Maximum Likelihood
Estimation) R package is designed to provide statistical software for the construction
of efficient estimators from data adaptive decision trees. The target parameter is the
average treatment effect (ATE) causal parameter defined as the counterfactual mean 
outcome if all individuals were jointly exposed to a combination of exposure levels in a mixed exposure compared to if all
individuals were not exposed. Here, the levels of a joint exposure are data-adaptively identified 
based on decision trees applied to a set of exposure variables while flexibly 
controlling for covariates non-parametrically. For more information on data-
adaptive parameters see [@Hubbard2016]. `CVtreeMLE` uses data-adaptive parameters 
by implementing V-fold cross-validation (CV), that is, in 10-fold CV, the data is split 10 
times (folds), where 90\% of the data is used to determine rules in a mixture, and the $g$ and $Q$
estimators needed for the ATE. These rules and estimators created in training data are applied to the validation data in order to calculate the final ATE target parameter. In order to optimize the optimum bias-variance trade-off for our causal parameter of interest we use cross-validated targeted minimum loss based estimation (CV-TMLE). `CVtreeMLE` builds off of the  CV-TMLE general theorem of cross-validated minimum loss based estimation @Zheng2010 which allows the full utilization of loss based super learning to obtain the initial estimators needed for our target parameter without risk of overfitting. Thus, `CVtreeMLE` makes possible the non-parametric estimation of the causal effects of a mixed exposure that both results in interpretable results which are useful for public policy and is asymptotically efficient. 

`CVtreeMLE` integrates with the [`sl3`package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle2021sl3]
to allow for ensemble
machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation procedure. `sl3` is used to create ensemble machine learning estimators for the $Q$ and $g$ mechanisms for the average treatment effect (ATE) target parameter and is also used in the iterative backfitting procedure In the iterative
backfitting procedure, for an enselbe of decision trees are fit on the full mixture modeled 
together, the [`pre` package](https://github.com/marjoleinF/pre)[@Fokkema2020a] is used to fit rule
ensembles. In backfitting procedure to find quantiles in each mixture component
individually, an Super Learner of decision trees generated from the [`partykit` package](http://partykit.r-forge.r-project.org/partykit/)[partykit2015] is created. In each case, the goal is to find the best fitting decision tree from which we extract decision tree rules, we then calculate the ATE for these rules.

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CVtreeMLE) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("CVtreeMLE")
```

_Note:_ If `CVtreeMLE` is installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CVtreeMLE), the `sl3`, an enhancing
dependency that allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance
parameter estimation, won't be included. We highly recommend additionally
installing `sl3` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r sl3-gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```

For the latest features, install the most recent _stable version_  of `CVtreeMLE`
from GitHub via [`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/CVtreeMLE@main")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `CVtreeMLE` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-devel-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/CVtreeMLE@devel")
```

## Example

To illustrate how `CVtreeMLE` may be used to ascertain the effect of a joint exposure,
consider the following example:

First load the package and other packages needed
```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
library(CVtreeMLE)
library(sl3)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(429153)
```

Use the `simulate_mixture_cube` function to generate simulated data that represents ground-truth. Here, we create three continuous mixture variables, $A$, that are correlated and baseline covariates, $W$, that are potential confounders. Our outcome will be generated such that individuals with a specific set of exposures have a different outcome compared to individuals who are not exposed to this combination of exposure levels. 


![](man/figures/The_Cube.png)
The above figure illustrates what we mean by a *mixture cube*. We will simulate data for the cube in blue but other mixture combinations are possible. Here, individuals exposed to $M_1$ at values less than 1.0, $M_2$ at levels more than 2.0, and $M_3$ at levels at or greater than 2.5 have an outcome of 6, compared to individuals not exposed to this combination of thresholds who have an expected outcome of 0 - thus our true mixture ATE is 6. Two covariates $W$ confound this relationship. Let's simulate this scenario.

## Simulate Data

```{r simulation inputs}
# number of observations we want to simulate
n_obs <- 500 
# split points for each mixture
splits <- c(0.99, 2.0, 2.5) 
# minimum values for each mixture
mins <- c(0, 0, 0) 
 # maximum value for each mixture
maxs <- c(3, 4, 5)
 # mu for each mixture
mu <- c(0, 0, 0)
# variance/covariance of mixture variables
sigma <- matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.8, 0.5, 1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 1), nrow = 3, ncol = 3) 
# subspace probability relationship with covariate W1
w1_betas <- c(0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.05, 0.2, 0.04) 
# subspace probability relationship with covariate W2
w2_betas <- c(0.0, 0.04, 0.01, 0.07, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.04) 
 # probability of mixture subspace (for multinomial outcome generation)
mix_subspace_betas <- c(0.00, 0.08, 0.05, 0.01, 0.05, 0.033, 0.07, 0.09)
# mixture subspace impact on outcome Y, here the subspace where M1 is lower and 
# M2 and M3 are higher based on values in splits
subspace_assoc_strength_betas <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0) 
# marginal impact of mixture component on Y
marginal_impact_betas <- c(0, 0, 0) 
# random error
eps_sd <- 0.01 
# if outcome is binary
binary <- FALSE
```

Above, the `subspace_assoc_strength_betas` parameter is used to indicate
the subspace we want to use and the expected outcome in that subspace.
The indices correspond to an area in the cube:

1.  All mixtures lower than specified thresholds
2.  M1 is higher but M2 and M3 are lower
3.  M2 is higher but M1 and M3 are lower
4.  M1 and M2 are higher and M3 is lower
5.  M3 is higher and M1 and M2 are lower
6.  M1 and M3 are higher and M2 is lower
7.  M2 and M3 are higher and M1 is lower
8.  All mixtures are higher than thresholds


```{r simulate data, warning=FALSE}
sim_data <- simulate_mixture_cube(
  n_obs = n_obs, 
  splits = splits,
  mins = mins,
  maxs = maxs,
  mu = mu,
  sigma = sigma,
  w1_betas = w1_betas,
  w2_betas = w2_betas,
  mix_subspace_betas = mix_subspace_betas,
  subspace_assoc_strength_betas = subspace_assoc_strength_betas,
  marginal_impact_betas = marginal_impact_betas,
  eps_sd = eps_sd,
  binary = binary
)

head(sim_data) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Simulated Data") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
## Set up Estimators used in Super Learners 

Here, we set up our Super Learner using `SL3` for the iterative backfitting procedure and for our $Q$ and $g$ mechanisms. These learners will fit $Y|W$ offset by $Y|A$ as we fit decision trees to the exposure variables both jointly and individually Once rules are established, this Super Learner will also estimate the the propensity of being exposed to the determined rule as well as estimating the outcome model.

```{r setup first stack learners}
lrnr_glm <- Lrnr_glm$new()
lrnr_bayesglm <- Lrnr_bayesglm$new()
lrnr_gam <- Lrnr_gam$new()
lrnr_lasso <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(alpha = 1)
lrnr_earth <- Lrnr_earth$new()
lrnr_ranger <- Lrnr_ranger$new()
# put all the learners together (this is just one way to do it)
learners <- c(lrnr_glm, lrnr_bayesglm, lrnr_gam, lrnr_ranger)

Q1_stack <- make_learner(Stack, learners)
```

Here, we set up a Super Learner of decision trees. We use a new learner developed for this package in the `sl3` ecosystem, `Lrnr_glmtree`. 


```{r setup tree stack learners}
lrnr_glmtree_001 <- Lrnr_glmtree$new(alpha = 0.5, maxdepth = 3)
lrnr_glmtree_002 <- Lrnr_glmtree$new(alpha = 0.6,  maxdepth = 4)
lrnr_glmtree_003 <- Lrnr_glmtree$new(alpha = 0.7, maxdepth = 2)
lrnr_glmtree_004 <- Lrnr_glmtree$new(alpha = 0.8, maxdepth = 1)

learners <- c( lrnr_glmtree_001, lrnr_glmtree_002, lrnr_glmtree_003, lrnr_glmtree_004)
discrete_sl_metalrn <- Lrnr_cv_selector$new()

tree_stack <- make_learner(Stack, learners)

discrete_tree_sl <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = tree_stack,
  metalearner = discrete_sl_metalrn
)

```

## Run `CVtreeMLE`

We will now pass the simulated data, learners, and variable names for each node in $O = W,A,Y$ to the `CVtreeMLE` function:

```{r run simulation}
ptm <- proc.time()

sim_results <- CVtreeMLE(data = sim_data,
                         W = c("W", "W2"),
                         Y = "y",
                         A = c(paste("M", seq(3), sep = "")),
                         back_iter_SL = Q1_stack,
                         tree_SL = discrete_tree_sl, 
                         n_folds = 2,
                         family = "gaussian",
                         H.AW_trunc_lvl = 10,
                         parallel = TRUE,
                         num_cores = 8,
                         max_iter = 5,
                         verbose = TRUE)

proc.time() - ptm 

```

Let's first look at the RMSE for the iterative back-fitting models. Because our rules are determined in these models, from which our target parameter is derived it's important that our models fit well.  Given our simulated data, we would expect the mixture model to have the lowest RMSE.

```{r model RMSE}
RMSE_results <- sim_results$`Model RMSEs`
head(RMSE_results) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Model Fit Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Our mixture decision tree model has the lowest RMSE. 

We can look at the pooled TMLE results for this model: 

```{r pooled mixture results}
mixture_results <- sim_results$`Pooled TMLE Mixture Results`
head(mixture_results) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Mixture Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
*Note - results in explanations below may change slightly based on runs: 

Above, the estimated mixture ATE for this rule is 5.92 (5.73 - 6.10), which covers our true mixture ATE used to generate the data which was 6. The estimated mixture ATE is interpreted as: the average counterfactual mean outcome if all individuals were exposed to the rule shown in `Mixture Interaction Rules` compared to if all individuals were unexposed is 5.92. That is, those individuals who are exposed to this rule have an outcome that is 5.92 higher compared to those that are not exposed to this rule. The standard error, confidence intervals and p-values are derived from the influence curve of this estimator.


```{r fold specific results}
mixture_v_results <- sim_results$`V-Specific Mix Results`
head(mixture_v_results) %>%
  kbl(caption = "V-Fold Mixture Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

We can plot our v-fold mixture results findings using the `plot_mixture_results` function. This will return a list of plots with names corresponding to the interactions found.

```{r plot sim mixture results}
mixture_plots <- plot_mixture_results(v_intxn_results = sim_results$`V-Specific Mix Results`, move_right = 1)
mixture_plots$M1M2M3
```


This plot shows the ATE specific for each fold and for the weighted-mean results over the fold with corresponding pooled variance. The rule is the pooled rule which includes all observations that were indicated by the fold specific rules. 


`CVtreeMLE` also data-adaptively identifies cut-points in the marginal space. Additional details for this and other features are given in the vignette.
