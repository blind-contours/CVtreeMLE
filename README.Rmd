> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Joint Exposure using Data Adaptive Decision Trees and Cross-Validated Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation
__Authors:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

---

## What is `CVtreeMLE`?

The `CVtreeMLE` (Cross-Validated Decision Trees with Targeted Maximum Likelihood
Estmation) R package is designed to provide statistical software for the construction
of efficient estimators of an average treatment effect (ATE) causal parameter 
defined as the counterfactual mean of an outcome if all individuals were jointly 
exposed to a combination of exposure levels in a mixed exposure compared to if all
individuals were not exposed. Here, a joint exposure is data-adaptively defined 
based on decision trees applied to a set of exposure variables while flexibly 
controlling for covariates non-parametrically. For more information on data-
adaptive parameters see [@Hubbard2016]. `CVtreeMLE` uses data-adaptive parameters 
by implementing V-fold cross-validation



`CVtreeMLE` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle2020sl3] to allow for ensemble
machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation procedure. `sl3` is used in 
the iterative backfitting procedure because this step requires ensemble machine 
learning with an offset for the decision tree predictions. In the Q and g mechanisms, 
`CVtreeMLE` uses the legacy [`Super Learner`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/SuperLearner) [@coyle2020sl3]. In the iterative
backfitting procedure, for decision tree fitting on the full mixture modeled 
together, the [`pre` package(PRE PACKAGE HERE)[citation] is used to fit rule
ensembles. In backfitting procedure to find thresholds in each mixture component
individually, the [`partykit` package](PARTYKIT PACKAGE HERE)[citation]. In both instances,
trees can be estimated with an offset from ensemble machine learning predictions.

For many practical applications (e.g., vaccine efficacy trials), observed data
is often subject to a two-phase sampling mechanism (i.e., through the use of a
two-stage design). In such cases, efficient estimators (of both varieties) must
be augmented to construct unbiased estimates of the population-level causal
parameter. @rose2011targeted2sd first introduced an augmentation procedure that
relies on introducing inverse probability of censoring (IPC) weights directly to
an appropriate loss function or to the efficient influence function estimating
equation. `CVtreeMLE` extends this approach to compute IPC-weighted one-step and
TML estimators of the counterfactual mean outcome under a shift stochastic
treatment regime. The package is designed to implement the statistical
methodology described in @hejazi2020efficient and extensions thereof.

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CVtreeMLE) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("CVtreeMLE")
```

_Note:_ If `CVtreeMLE` is installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CVtreeMLE), the `sl3`, an enhancing
dependency that allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance
parameter estimation, won't be included. We highly recommend additionally
installing `sl3` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r sl3-gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@master")
```

For the latest features, install the most recent _stable version_  of `CVtreeMLE`
from GitHub via [`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/CVtreeMLE@master")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `CVtreeMLE` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-devel-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/CVtreeMLE@devel")
```

## Example

To illustrate how `CVtreeMLE` may be used to ascertain the effect of a joint exposure,
consider the following example:

First load the package and other packages needed
```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
library(CVtreeMLE)
library(sl3)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)
library(jtools)


set.seed(429153)
```

Use the `simulate_mixture_cube` function to generate simulated data that represents ground-truth. Here, we create three continuous mixture variables, $A$, that are correlated and baseline covariates, $W$, that are potential confounders. Our outcome will be generated such that individuals with a specific set of exposures have a different outcome compared to individuals who are not exposed to this combination of exposure levels. 


![](inst/The_Cube.png)
The above figure illustrates the data we will generate using this function. Here, individuals exposed to $M_1$ at values less than 1.0, $M_2$ at levels more than 2.0, and $M_3$ at levels at or greater than 2.5 have an outcome of 6, compared to individuals not exposed to this combination of thresholds who have an expected outcome of 0 - thus our ATE is 6. Two covariates $W$ confound this relationship. Let's simulate this scenario.


```{r simulation inputs}
n_obs <- 500 # number of observations we want to simulate
splits <- c(0.99, 2.0, 2.5) # split points for each mixture
mins <- c(0, 0, 0) # minimum values for each mixture
maxs <- c(3, 4, 5) # maximum value for each mixture
mu <- c(0, 0, 0) # mu for each mixture
sigma <- matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.8, 0.5, 1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 1), nrow = 3, ncol = 3) # variance/covariance of mixture variables
w1_betas <- c(0.0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1, 0.05, 0.2, 0.04) # subspace probability relationship with covariate W1
w2_betas <- c(0.0, 0.04, 0.01, 0.07, 0.15, 0.1, 0.1, 0.04) # subspace probability relationship with covariate W2
mix_subspace_betas <- c(0.00, 0.08, 0.05, 0.01, 0.05, 0.033, 0.07, 0.09) # probability of mixture subspace (for multinomial outcome generation)
subspace_assoc_strength_betas <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0) # mixture subspace impact on outcome Y, here the subspace where M1 is lower and M2 and M3 are higher based on values in splits
marginal_impact_betas <- c(0, 0, 0) # marginal impact of mixture component on Y
eps_sd <- 0.01 # random error
binary <- FALSE # if outcome is binary
```

```{r simulate data, warning=FALSE}
sim_data <- simulate_mixture_cube(
  n_obs = n_obs, 
  splits = splits,
  mins = mins,
  maxs = maxs,
  mu = mu,
  sigma = sigma,
  w1_betas = w1_betas,
  w2_betas = w2_betas,
  mix_subspace_betas = mix_subspace_betas,
  subspace_assoc_strength_betas = subspace_assoc_strength_betas,
  marginal_impact_betas = marginal_impact_betas,
  eps_sd = eps_sd,
  binary = binary
)

head(sim_data) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Simulated Data") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```
Here, we set up our Super Learner using `SL3` for the iterative backfitting procedure. These learners will fit $Y|W$ offset by $Y|A$ as we fit decision trees to the exposure variables both jointly and individially.

```{r setup first stack learners}
lrnr_glm <- Lrnr_glm$new()
lrnr_bayesglm <- Lrnr_bayesglm$new()
lrnr_gam <- Lrnr_gam$new()
lrnr_lasso <- Lrnr_glmnet$new(alpha = 1)
lrnr_earth <- Lrnr_earth$new()
lrnr_ranger <- Lrnr_ranger$new()
lrnr_xgboost100 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 100, early_stopping_rounds = 10)
lrnr_xgboost50 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 50, early_stopping_rounds = 5)
lrnr_xgboost20 <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 20)
# put all the learners together (this is just one way to do it)
learners <- c(lrnr_glm, lrnr_bayesglm,
lrnr_gam, lrnr_ranger,
lrnr_xgboost100, lrnr_xgboost50, lrnr_xgboost20)

Q1_stack <- make_learner(Stack, learners)
```

This second stack of learners will be used in our Q and g mechanisms after we identify rules using the first stack.
```{r setup second stack learners}

SL.library<- c('SL.randomForest',
               'SL.earth',
               "SL.glm",
               "SL.mean")
```

We will now pass the simulated data, learners, and variable names for each node in $O = W,A,Y$ to the `CVtreeMLE` function:

```{r run simulation}
ptm <- proc.time

sim_results <- CVtreeMLE(data = sim_data,
                                   W = c("W", "W2"),
                                   Y = "y",
                                   A = c(paste("M", seq(3), sep = "")),
                                   back_iter_SL = Q1_stack,
                                   SL.library = SL.library,
                                   n_folds = 4,
                                   family = "gaussian",
                                   H.AW_trunc_lvl = 10,
                                   parallel = TRUE,
                                   verbose = FALSE)

ptm - proc.time

```

Let's look at the marginal results first. These are the rules found for each individual variable in the vector of exposures while controlling for other exposures and covariates. 

```{r marginal results}

marginal_results <- sim_results$`Marginal Results`
head(marginal_results) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Marginal Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```


```{r mixture results}

mixture_results <- sim_results$`Mixture Results`
head(mixture_results) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Mixture Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Across the folds, the expected outcome given the cumulative sum of marginal exposures is also estimated. That is, answering a question such as "What is the exposure specific mean for each additional exposure level".

```{r plot cumulative sum effects, fig.keep='all'}
cumulative_sum_plot <- effect_plot(sim_results$`Additive MSM`, 
            pred = sum_marg_hits, 
            interval = TRUE, 
            y.label = "Expected Outcome",
            x.label = "Cumulative Exposure",
            cat.geom = "line",
            colors = "black")

cumulative_sum_plot

```

In the plot above, we see the expected outcome given exposure to none of the rules found for each individual variable, exposure to any 1 rule for $M_1$, $M_2$ or $M_3$, any two or all three.
