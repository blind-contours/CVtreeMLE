> Discovery of Critical Thresholds in Mixed Exposures and Estimation of Policy Intervention Effects using Targeted Learning

__Author:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

---

## What is `CVtreeMLE`?
This package operationalizes the methodology presented here: 

https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07976

People often encounter multiple simultaneous exposures (e.g. several drugs or pollutants). Policymakers are interested in setting safe limits, interdictions, or recommended dosage combinations based on a combination of thresholds, one per exposure. Setting these thresholds is difficult because all relevant interactions between exposures must be accounted for. Previous statistical methods have used parametric estimators which do not directly address the question of safe exposure limits, rely on unrealistic assumptions, and do not result in a threshold based statistical quantity that is directly relevant to policy regulators. 

Here we present an estimator that a) identifies thresholds that minimize/maximize the expected outcome controlling for covariates and other exposures; and which b) efficiently estimates a policy intervention which compares the expected outcome if everyone was forced to these safe levels compared to the observed outcome under observed exposure distribution. 

This is done by using cross-validation where in training folds of the data, a custom g-computation tree-based search algorithm finds the minimizing region, and an estimation sample is used to estimate the policy intervention using targeted maximum likelihood estimation.

## Inputs and Outputs

This package takes in a mixed exposure, covariates, outcome, super learner stacks
of learners if determined (if not default are used), number of folds, minimum observations in a region, if the desired region is minimizer or maximizer and parallelization parameters.

The output are k-fold specific results for the region found in each fold with valid inference, a pooled estimate of the overall oracle parameter across all folds and pooled exposure sets if the region has some inconsistency across the folds.

## Installation

*Note:* Because `CVtreeMLE` package (currently) depends on `sl3` that
allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance parameter
estimation and `sl3` is not on CRAN the `CVtreeMLE` package is not
available on CRAN and must be downloaded here.

There are many dependencies for `CVtreeMLE` so it's easier to break up 
installation of the various packages to ensure proper installation. 

`CVtreeMLE` uses the `sl3` package to build ensemble machine learners for each nuisance parameter. 


Install `sl3` on devel:

```{r sl3_devel, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```

Make sure `sl3` installs correctly then install `CVtreeMLE`

```{r CVtreeMLE_install,  eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/CVtreeMLE@main")
```

---

## Example

First load the package and other packages needed

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(CVtreeMLE)
library(sl3)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)
seed <- 98484
set.seed(seed)
```


To illustrate how `CVtreeMLE` may be used to find and estimate a region that, if intervened on would lead to the biggest reduction in an outcome we use synthetic data from the National Institute of Environmental Health: 

## National Institute of Environmental Health Data

The 2015 NIEHS Mixtures Workshop was 
developed to determine if new mixture methods detect ground-truth interactions
built into the simulated data. In this way we can simultaneously show
`CVtreeMLE` output, interpretation and validity. 

For detailed information on this simulated data please see: 

https://github.com/niehs-prime/2015-NIEHS-MIxtures-Workshop


```{r load_NIEHS_data, warning=FALSE}
niehs_data <- NIEHS_data_1

head(niehs_data) %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "NIEHS Data") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria")
```


Briefly, this synthetic data can be considered the results of a prospective
cohort epidemiologic study. The outcome cannot cause the exposures (as might
occur in a cross-sectional study). Correlations between exposure variables can
be thought of as caused by common sources or modes of exposure. The nuisance 
variable Z can be assumed to be a potential confounder and not a collider.
There are 7 exposures which have a complicated dependency structure. $X_3$ and
$X_6$ do not have an impact on the outcome. 

One issue is that many machine learning algorithms will fail given only 1 
variable passed as a feature so let's add some other covariates.

```{r add_covariates, warning=FALSE}
niehs_data$Z2 <- rbinom(nrow(niehs_data),
  size = 1,
  prob = 0.3
)

niehs_data$Z3 <- rbinom(nrow(niehs_data),
  size = 1,
  prob = 0.1
)
```


## Run `CVtreeMLE`


```{r run_simulation, warnings = FALSE, message=FALSE}
ptm <- proc.time()

niehs_results <- CVtreeMLE(
  data = as.data.frame(niehs_data),
  w = c("Z", "Z2", "Z3"),
  a = c(paste("X", seq(7), sep = "")),
  y = "Y",
  n_folds = 10,
  seed = seed,
  parallel_cv = TRUE,
  parallel = TRUE,
  family = "continuous",
  num_cores = 8,
  min_max = "min",
  max_depth = 2, 
  min_obs = 25
)
proc.time() - ptm
```

## Mixture Results

First let's look at the k-fold specific estimates:

```{r k_fold_results}
k_fold_results <- niehs_results$`V-Specific Mix Results`

k_fold_results %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "K-fold Results") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria")
```

This indicates that the exposure X2 was found in every fold to have the most minimizing impact on endocrine disruption if all individuals were were forced to be exposed to levels less around 0.41. This resembles a policy where, if everyone were still exposed to the other exposures but we created a regulation that restricted individuals to only exposure of X2 less than 0.41.  

The pooled estimates, leveraging all the folds for our estimates oracle target parameter looks like:

```{r oracle_results}
pooled_mixture_results <- niehs_results$`Oracle Region Results`

pooled_mixture_results %>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Oracle Mixture Results") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria")
```


Additional details for this and other features are given in the vignette.
