> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Joint Exposure using Data 
Adaptive Decision Trees and Cross-Validated Targeted Maximum Likelihood 
Estimation
__Authors:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

## What is `CVtreeMLE`?

The `CVtreeMLE` (Cross-Validated Decision Trees with Targeted Maximum 
Likelihood Estimation) R package is designed to provide statistical 
software for the construction of efficient estimators 
from data adaptive decision trees. The target parameter
is the average treatment effect (ATE) causal parameter defined as the 
counterfactual mean outcome if all individuals were jointly exposed to a 
combination of exposure levels in a mixed exposure compared to if all
individuals were not exposed. Here, the levels of a joint exposure are 
data-adaptively identified  based on decision trees applied to a set of 
exposure variables while flexibly controlling for covariates non-parametrically.
For more information on data-adaptive parameters see [@Hubbard2016]. 

`CVtreeMLE` uses data-adaptive parameters by implementing V-fold 
cross-validation (CV), that is, in 10-fold CV, the data 
is split 10 times (folds), where 90\% of the data is used to determine rules
in a mixture, and the $g$ (probability of being exposued estimator, P(A|W)) 
and $Q$ (outcome estimator E(Y|A,W)) estimators needed for the ATE. These rules 
and estimators created in training data are applied to the validation data 
in order to calculate the final ATE target parameter. 

In order to optimize the optimum bias-variance trade-off for 
our causal parameter of interest we use cross-validated targeted minimum loss 
based estimation (CV-TMLE). `CVtreeMLE` builds off of the  CV-TMLE general
theorem of cross-validated minimum loss based estimation @Zheng2010 which 
allows the full utilization of loss based super learning to obtain the initial 
estimators needed for our target parameter without risk of overfitting. Thus, 
`CVtreeMLE` makes possible the non-parametric estimation of the causal effects
of a mixed exposure that both results in interpretable results which are useful
for public policy and are asymptotically efficient. 

`CVtreeMLE` integrates with the [`sl3`package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) 
[@coyle2021sl3] to allow for ensemble machine learning to be leveraged 
in the estimation procedure. `sl3` is used to 
create ensemble machine learning estimators for the $Q$ and $g$ mechanisms for 
the average treatment effect (ATE) target parameter. `sl3`  is also used in the 
iterative backfitting procedure. In the iterative
backfitting procedure,  an ensemble of decision trees are fit on the full 
mixture modeled 
together, the [`pre` package](https://github.com/marjoleinF/pre)[@Fokkema2020a]
is used to fit rule
ensembles. In backfitting procedure to find thresholds in each mixture component
individually, a Super Learner of decision trees generated from the [`partykit` package](http://partykit.r-forge.r-project.org/partykit/)[partykit2015] are 
created. In each case, the goal is to find the best fitting decision tree 
from which we extract decision tree rules, we then calculate the ATE for 
these rules.

Below we simulate data for a "mixture cube" and show basic results from 
`CVtreeMLE` compared to ground-truth. For more details, please see the vignette.

## Installation

_Note:_ Because `CVtreeMLE` package (currently) depends on `sl3`, 
an enhancing dependency that allows ensemble machine learning to be used for 
nuisance parameter estimation and `sl3` is not on CRAN the `CVtreeMLE` package 
is not available on CRAN and must be downloaded here. 

For the latest features, install the most recent _stable version_  
of `CVtreeMLE`from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/CVtreeMLE@main")
```

`CVtreeMLE` uses newly added decision tree estimators added to `sl3` so please 
download sl3 from:
```{r sl3-gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```

---

## Example

First load the package and other packages needed

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
library(CVtreeMLE)
library(sl3)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(429153)
```


To illustrate how `CVtreeMLE` may be used to ascertain the effect of a joint 
exposure, consider three exposures. We can represent these exposures as a cube,
this is depicted below: 

![](man/figures/The_Cube.png)

This figure shows two regions we may be interested in within the mixture space.
On the left, the orange region is where $M_1$ is less than 1, $M_2$ is greater
than 2 and $M_3$ is less than 2.5. If we were to generate this data, we'd 
expect `CVtreeMLE` to find these thresholds in the mixture space. Likewise, 
in blue this shows the region where  $M_1$ is less than 1, $M_2$ is greater
than 2 and $M_3$ is greater than 2.5. We want to simulate an outcome that 
is highest in this region and where the size of the region is based on 
covariates. 


To do this, use the `simulate_mixture_cube` function to generate simulated    
data that represents ground-truth. Here, we create three continuous mixture 
variables, $A$, that are correlated and baseline covariates, $W$, that are 
potential confounders. Our outcome will be generated such that individuals 
with a specific set of exposures have a different outcome compared to 
individuals who are not exposed to this combination of exposure levels. 

## Simulate Data

```{r simulate data, warning=FALSE}
sim_data <- simulate_mixture_cube(n_obs = 800,
                                  splits = c(0.99, 2.0, 2.5),
                                  mins = c(0, 0, 0),
                                  maxs = c(3, 4, 5),
                                  subspace_assoc_strength_betas = c(0, 0, 0, 0,
                                                                    0, 0, 6, 0))
head(sim_data) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Simulated Data") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria")
```
Using the `simulate_mixture_cube` we generate 500 observations that are 
exposed to three variables with min values being 0 for all and max values being
3,4, and 5. In each variable we define split points 0.99, 2.0, and 2.5. Given the 
eight regions in the cube, the `subspace_assoc_strength_betas` parameter is 
where we put the outcome in a specific region. 

The indices correspond to an area in the cube:

1.  All mixtures lower than specified thresholds
2.  M1 is higher but M2 and M3 are lower
3.  M2 is higher but M1 and M3 are lower
4.  M1 and M2 are higher and M3 is lower
5.  M3 is higher and M1 and M2 are lower
6.  M1 and M3 are higher and M2 is lower
7.  M2 and M3 are higher and M1 is lower
8.  All mixtures are higher than thresholds

So here - we put 6 at index 7 which means the outcome is 6 when 
M2 and M3 are higher and M1 is lower than their respective split points. The 
outcome is 0 in all other regions. 

## Run `CVtreeMLE`

We will now pass the simulated data, learners, and variable names for each 
node in $O = W,A,Y$ to the `CVtreeMLE` function:

```{r run simulation}
ptm <- proc.time()

sim_results <- CVtreeMLE(data = sim_data,
                         w = c("w", "w2"),
                         a = c(paste("M", seq(3), sep = "")),
                         y = "y",
                         n_folds = 5,
                         parallel_cv = TRUE,
                         seed = 2333,
                         parallel_type = "multi_session",
                         family = "gaussian",
                         num_cores = 2)

proc.time() - ptm
```

Note that above, there are default estimators for all parameters if they are
not passed to the function. Here we just use the out of the box estimators 
that are defined in `utils_create_sls.R`. These estimators are chosen to be
both non-parametric but also not too computationally demanding. Examples 
of estimators used by default are random forest, xgboost, elastic net, and glms. 
Users can also pass in their own custom stacks of learners. We also see here 
that, using 2 cores with these learners on our simulated data with 500 
observations and 6 variables, our run time is 21 minutes. This can be 
greatly improved by increasing the num_cores. 

## Results

We can look at the pooled TMLE results for this model. Let's see if 
`CVtreeMLE` identified the current rule in all our folds: 

```{r pooled mixture results}
mixture_results <- sim_results$`Pooled TMLE Mixture Results`
mixture_results %>%
  dplyr::filter(Proportion_Folds == 1.0) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Mixture Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria")
```

Above, the estimated mixture ATE for this rule is 5.96 (5.6 - 6.4), which 
covers our true mixture ATE used to generate the data which was 6. The 
estimated mixture ATE is interpreted as: the average counterfactual mean 
outcome if all individuals were exposed to the rule shown in 
`Union Rule` compared to if all individuals were unexposed is 
5.96. That is, those individuals who are exposed to this rule have an outcome 
that is 5.96 higher compared to those that are not exposed to this rule. The 
standard error, confidence intervals and p-values are derived from the 
influence curve of this estimator.

We can also look at the v-fold specific results. For inconsistent rules this
gives better interpretability with valid statistical inference. Below we show
the v-fold specific interactions found with fold specific estimates of our
ATE target parameter and variance estimates from the fold specific IC. 

```{r fold specific results}
mixture_v_results <- sim_results$`V-Specific Mix Results`
mixture_v_results$M1M2M3
```
In v-fold specific results we also give a pooled estimate. This is different 
than the pooled TMLE estimate. Here we simply take the weighted average of the 
fold specific ATEs and the harmonic mean of the variances. 

We can plot our v-fold mixture results findings using the `plot_mixture_results` 
function. This will return a list of plots with names corresponding to the
interactions found.

```{r plot sim_mixture_results}
mixture_plots <- plot_mixture_results(v_intxn_results =
                                        sim_results$`V-Specific Mix Results`,
                                      hjust = 1.05)
mixture_plots$M1M2M3
```
This plot shows the ATE specific for each fold and for the weighted-mean 
results over the fold with corresponding pooled variance. The rule is the 
pooled rule which includes all observations that were indicated by the 
fold specific rules. 

`CVtreeMLE` also data-adaptively identifies thresholds in the marginal space. 
These around found here:

```{r pooled marginal results}
marginal_results <- sim_results$`Pooled TMLE Marginal Results`
marginal_results %>%
  dplyr::filter(`Proportion in Fold` == 1.0) %>%
  kbl(caption = "Marginal Results") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = FALSE, html_font = "Cambria")
```
