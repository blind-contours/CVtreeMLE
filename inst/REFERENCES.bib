abstract = {Background: Exposure mixtures frequently occur in data across many domains, particularly in the fields of environmental and nutritional epidemiology. Various strategies have arisen to answer questions about exposure mixtures, including methods such as weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression that estimate a joint effect of the mixture components. Objectives: We demonstrate a new approach to estimating the joint effects of a mixture: quantile g-computation. This approach combines the inferential simplicity of WQS regression with the flexibility of g-computation, a method of causal effect estimation. We use simulations to examine whether quantile g-computation and WQS regression can accurately and precisely estimate effects of mixtures in a variety of common scenarios. Methods: We examine the bias, confidence interval coverage, and bias-variance tradeoff of quantile g-computation and WQS regression, and how these quantities are impacted by the presence of non-causal exposures, exposure correlation, unmeasured confounding, and non-linearity of exposure effects. Results: Quantile g-computation, unlike WQS regression allows inference on mixture effects that is unbiased with appropriate confidence interval coverage at sample sizes typically encountered in epidemiologic studies, and when the assumptions of WQS regression are not met. Further, WQS regression can magnify bias from unmeasured confounding that might occur if important components of the mixture are omitted from analysis. Discussion: Unlike inferential approaches that examine effects of individual exposures, while holding other exposures constant, methods like quantile g-computation that can estimate the effect of a mixture are essential for understanding effects of potential public health actions that act on exposure sources. Our approach may serve to help bridge gaps between epidemiologic analysis and interventions such as regulations on industrial emissions or mining processes, dietary changes, or consumer behavioral changes that act on multiple exposures simultaneously.},

abstract = {Environmental risk factors have been implicated in adverse health effects. Previous epidemiological studies on environmental risk factors mainly analyzed the impact of single pollutant exposure on health, while in fact, humans are constantly exposed to a complex mixture consisted of multiple pollutants/chemicals. In recent years, environmental epidemiologists have sought to assess adverse health effects of exposure to multi-pollutant mixtures based on the diversity of real-world environmental pollutants. However, the statistical challenges are considerable, for instance, multicollinearity and interaction among components of the mixture complicate the statistical analysis. There is currently no consensus on appropriate statistical methods. Here we summarized the practical statistical methods used in environmental epidemiology to estimate health effects of exposure to multi-pollutant mixture, such as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions, shrinkage methods (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, elastic network model, adaptive elastic-net model, and principal component analysis), environment-wide association study (EWAS), etc. We sought to review these statistical methods and determine the application conditions, strengths, weaknesses, and result interpretability of each method, providing crucial insight and assistance for addressing epidemiological statistical issues regarding health effects from multi-pollutant mixture.},

@article{Athey2016a,
abstract = {In this paper we propose methods for estimating heterogeneity in
causal effects in experimental and observational studies and for conducting
hypothesis tests about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects across
subsets of the population. We provide a data-driven approach to partition the
data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment
effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals
for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size,
and without "sparsity" assumptions. We propose an "honest" approach to
estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another
to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on
regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment
effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion
anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts
for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect
estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the
"ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit,
so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a
simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation
results in nominal coverage for 90% confidence intervals, whereas coverage
ranges between 74% and 84% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation
requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the cost in terms
of mean squared error of treatment effects for our preferred method ranges
between 7-22%.},

offering highly inter-pretable regression and classification models. This paper
shows how they can be fitted using function pre from R package pre, which
derives PREs largely through the method-ology of Friedman and Popescu (2008).
The implementation and functionality of pre is described and illustrated through
application on a dataset on the prediction of depres-sion. Furthermore, accuracy
and sparsity of pre is compared with that of single trees, random forests, lasso
regression and the original RuleFit implementation of Friedman and Popescu
(2008) in four benchmark datasets. Results indicate that pre derives ensembles
with predictive accuracy similar to that of random forests, while using a
smaller number of variables for prediction. Furthermore, pre provided
better accuracy and sparsity than the original RuleFit implementation.},

@article{Hubbard2016,
abstract = {Consider one observes n i.i.d. copies of a random variable with a probability distribution that is known to be an element of a particular statistical model. In order to define our statistical target we partition the sample in V equal size sub-samples, and use this partitioning to define V splits in an estimation sample (one of the V subsamples) and corresponding complementary parameter-generating sample. For each of the V parameter-generating samples, we apply an algorithm that maps the sample to a statistical target parameter. We define our sample-split data adaptive statistical target parameter as the average of these V-sample specific target parameters. We present an estimator (and corresponding central limit theorem) of this type of data adaptive target parameter. This general methodology for generating data adaptive target parameters is demonstrated with a number of practical examples that highlight new opportunities for statistical learning from data. This new framework provides a rigorous statistical methodology for both exploratory and confirmatory analysis within the same data. Given that more research is becoming "data-driven", the theory developed within this paper provides a new impetus for a greater involvement of statistical inference into problems that are being increasingly addressed by clever, yet ad hoc pattern finding methods. To suggest such potential, and to verify the predictions of the theory, extensive simulation studies, along with a data analysis based on adaptively determined intervention rules are shown and give insight into how to structure such an approach. The results show that the data adaptive target parameter approach provides a general framework and resulting methodology for data-driven science.},

@article{Rubin2005,
Abstract = { Causal effects are defined as comparisons of potential outcomes under different treatments on a common set of units. Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism---a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials. },
