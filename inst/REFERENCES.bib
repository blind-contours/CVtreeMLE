abstract = {Prediction rule ensembles (PREs) are sparse collections of rules, offering highly inter-pretable regression and classification models. This paper shows how they can be fitted using function pre from R package pre, which derives PREs largely through the method-ology of Friedman and Popescu (2008). The implementation and functionality of pre is described and illustrated through application on a dataset on the prediction of depres-sion. Furthermore, accuracy and sparsity of pre is compared with that of single trees, random forests, lasso regression and the original RuleFit implementation of Friedman and Popescu (2008) in four benchmark datasets. Results indicate that pre derives ensembles with predictive accuracy similar to that of random forests, while using a smaller number of variables for prediction. Furthermore, pre provided better accuracy and sparsity than the original RuleFit implementation.},

@article{Hubbard2016,
abstract = {Consider one observes n i.i.d. copies of a random variable with a probability distribution that is known to be an element of a particular statistical model. In order to define our statistical target we partition the sample in V equal size sub-samples, and use this partitioning to define V splits in an estimation sample (one of the V subsamples) and corresponding complementary parameter-generating sample. For each of the V parameter-generating samples, we apply an algorithm that maps the sample to a statistical target parameter. We define our sample-split data adaptive statistical target parameter as the average of these V-sample specific target parameters. We present an estimator (and corresponding central limit theorem) of this type of data adaptive target parameter. This general methodology for generating data adaptive target parameters is demonstrated with a number of practical examples that highlight new opportunities for statistical learning from data. This new framework provides a rigorous statistical methodology for both exploratory and confirmatory analysis within the same data. Given that more research is becoming "data-driven", the theory developed within this paper provides a new impetus for a greater involvement of statistical inference into problems that are being increasingly addressed by clever, yet ad hoc pattern finding methods. To suggest such potential, and to verify the predictions of the theory, extensive simulation studies, along with a data analysis based on adaptively determined intervention rules are shown and give insight into how to structure such an approach. The results show that the data adaptive target parameter approach provides a general framework and resulting methodology for data-driven science.},

@article{Zheng2010,
abstract = {We consider a targeted maximum likelihood estimator of a path-wise differen- tiable parameter of the data generating distribution in a semi-parametric model based on observing n independent and identically distributed observations. The targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) uses V-fold sample splitting for the initial estimator in order to make the TMLE maximally robust in its bias re- duction step. We prove a general theorem that states asymptotic efficiency (and thereby regularity) of the targeted maximum likelihood estimator when the initial estimator is consistent and a second order term converges to zero in probability at a rate faster than the square root of the sample size, but no other meaningful conditions are needed. In particular, the conditions of this theorem allow the full utilization of loss based super learning to obtain the initial estimator. In particular, the theorem proves that first order efficient and unbiased estima- tion is enhanced in an important way by using adaptive estimators such as an super learner, thereby formally dealing with the concern that adaptive estimation might make it harder to construct valid confidence intervals. On the contrary, the theorem teaches us that to achieve first order efficiency and regularity, it is crucial to estimate the relevant parts of the true data generating distribution as good as possible. The theorem is applied to prove asymptotic efficiency of the targeted maximum likelihood estimator of the additive causal effect of a binary treatment on an outcome in a randomized controlled trial and in an observational study. Excellent finite sample performance of this estimator has been demonstrated in past articles (e.g.van der Laan et al. (September, 2009), Gruber and van der Laan (2010), Stitelman and van der Laan (2010), Petersen et al. (2010).},

@article{Rubin2005,
	Abstract = { Causal effects are defined as comparisons of potential outcomes under different treatments on a common set of units. Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism---a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials. },
